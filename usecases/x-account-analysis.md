# X Account Analysis

There are many websites designed to give you a qualitative analysis of your X account. While X already gives you an **analytics** section, it's more focused to show your numbers on your performance.

But a qualitative analysis focuses on the quality of your posts, not the performance stats. Some insights you can get from this type of analysis:
- What are the patterns that make my posts go viral?
- What topics I talk about get me most engagement?
- Why do I get posts with 1000+ likes but sometimes posts with <5 likes? What am I doing wrong?

There are many websites and apps designed to give you X analytics, but they focus on the statistics. There are probably 1-2 websites that let you talk with an AI to understand your performance. 

But now you can use OpenClaw to do this analysis for you, without needing to pay $10-$50 for subscriptions on these websites.

## Skills you Need
Bird Skill. `clawhub install bird` (it comes pre-bundled)

## How to Set it Up
Here's the flow:
1. Make sure Bird skill is working.
2. For security and isolation, you better create a new account for your ClawdBot.
3. Auth with your X account. log into x.com in Chrome/Brave, and provide the right cookie information (`auth-token`, `ct0`) so OpenClaw can access your account.
4. Ask OpenClaw to take a look at your real account, fetch the last N tweets, and ask it any questions you like. Alternatively, you can ask it to write you specific scripts.
